# Generative-art-
## A brief introduction to the world of computer generated art.
### Motivation
What I've learnt this week is that creative computing might not be my thing. A lack of Arduino experimentation on this read-me file will attest to that *(I couldnt get that LED to light up no matter how hard I tried...)*. That is not to say however that I cannot appreciate the marvels of computing in creative practice. 
[@gengeomergence](https://www.instagram.com/gengeomergence/) is an artist that I recently followed on instagram. His page is filled with crazy patterns that look like bacteria growing on a petri dish, or skyscrapers sprouting out of the ground at random angles. I was intrigued by the methods he used and came across what is called **Generative or Algorithmic art**.

### What is Computer generated art? ###
This is any sort of pattern, form or shape created algorithmically by a computer adhering to a set of rules. There is a certain sense of relinquishing control as the artist ultimately lets the computer create the art in a completely unpredictable way.

Generative art is not simply randomly generated patterns or shapes, it can also be ideas. A famous example of this is Keith Turner's *'Art Machine'* which relied in a whole host of programmes and methods to algorithmically generate words and concepts that he then converted into tangible art.

### Harold Cohen's *AARON* ###
This was a machine created by Harold Cohen that would randomly generate abstract art, as well as more complex things such as humans and plants on its own accord. He used the machine in tandem with a plotter to create real life generative artwork. Harold Cohen has often been seen as the forefather of generative artwork.

### L system ###
In conclusion, there's lots of different methods of creating these generative pieces. A simple L system is possibly one of the easiest to grasp.
>L-systems are often used in procedural graphics to make natural, geometric, or interesting "fractal-style" patterns.

Have a go at editing this piece of code to change the appearance of this L system pattern [here](https://p5js.org/examples/simulate-l-systems.html)
